## Chess-Of-Thoughts


### Overview

This repo is a full training pipeline to train a LLM with enhanced chess reasoning capabilities

It is still massively WIP, but here is a quick roadmap:
- [ ] Train a chess encoder model
- [ ] Adapt a LLM to take chess position embeddings as an auxiliary input
- [ ] Make a dataset to train the LLM
- [ ] Train the LLM and benchmark it
- [ ] Make a demo
